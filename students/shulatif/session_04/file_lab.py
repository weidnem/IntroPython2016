import os


# write a program which prints the full path to all files in the current directory, one per line

print(os.path())


# write a program which copies a file from a source, to a destination (without using shutil, or the OS copy command)
#      advanced: make it work for any size file: i.e. donâ€™t read the entire contents of the file into memory at once.
#      Note that if you want it to do any kind of file, you need to open the files in binary mode: open(filename, 'rb')
#      (or 'wb' for writing.)

# Write a little script that reads that file, and generates a list of all the languages that have been used. students.txt

# Extra credit: keep track of how many students specified each language.
