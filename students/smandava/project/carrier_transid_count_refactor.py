Project description:
[1] File1 contains transaction IDs (from a log file) from server1. File size ~24K.
[2] File2 contains log data from server2. Every line in the log data on server2 does not have to contain transaction IDs from step1. File size ~480MB.
[3] Search for the occurrences of transaction IDs from server1 and IP address1 in the server2's log data and get final count.
[4] Search for the occurrences of transaction IDs from server1 and IP address2 in the server2's log data and get final count.
[5] Verify the counts in step 3 and step4 match.
[6] Use decorators or context managers.
