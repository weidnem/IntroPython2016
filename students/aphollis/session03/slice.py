"""-----Slicing Lab----
Goal
    Get the basics of sequence slicing down

Tasks
    Write some functions that:

    -return a sequence with the first and last items exchanged.
    -return a sequence with every other item removed
    -return a sequence with the first and last 4 items removed, and every other item in between
    -return a sequence reversed (just with slicing)
    -return a sequence with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order
            NOTE: these should work with ANY sequence â€“ but you can use strings to test, if you like.
