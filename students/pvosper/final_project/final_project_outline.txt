=== FINAL PROJECT OUTLINE ===

Personal Project The bulk of the homework for the rest of the class will be a
personal project:

It can be for fun, or something you need for your job. It should be large enough
to take a few weeks homework time to do. It should demostrate that you can do
something useful with python. It should follow PEP8
(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) It should have unit tests! Ideally,
it will be in version control (gitHub) I don’t require any specific python
features (i.e. classes): use what is appropriate for your project Due the Sunday
after the last class (December 11)

By next week, send me a project proposal: short and sweet.

Final Project Proposal:

In Destiny, each Destination has assets preloaded through Tag Bags - a single
file that contains references to individual assets as well as to Budget Sets,
which are themselves collections of references to assets.

Goal: Create report that lists all referenced assets, sorted by Destination

1) Create dictionary with Destinations and their associated Tag Bag
    1.1) Crawl a folder that contains Destination folders
    1.2) In each folder, find the .grognok_map file
    1.3) In each map file, find the reference for .global_tag_bag
2) Create dictionary for each common Budget Set and their associated assets
    1.1) Crawl a folder that contains Budget Sets
    1.2) In each Budget Set, find all references to assets
3) Create report that lists all referenced assets, sorted by Destination
