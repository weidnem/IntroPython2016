'''Write some functions that:

return a sequence with the first and last items exchanged.
return a sequence with every other item removed
return a sequence with the first and last 4 items removed, and every other item in between
return a sequence reversed (just with slicing)
return a sequence with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order
NOTE: these should work with ANY sequence â€“ but you can use strings to test, if you like.'''
