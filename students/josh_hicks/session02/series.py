'''Fibonacci Series Exercise
Goal:
The Fibonacci Series is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1.

In this series, the next integer is determined by summing the previous two.

This gives us:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
We will write a function that computes this series â€“ then generalize it.'''
